# Musicflut
Musicflut is just like pixelflut, but it plays music via midi. You can use any software/hardware midi synthesizer that
can read a standard midi port. I prefer helm (https://tytel.org/helm/) as it is a nice polyphonic synth.

## Setup
I use pipenv to create a virtual environment. So the easiest way to install all requirements is to use pipenv.
